## Challenge

The funding organisation I am applying to requires a Data Management Plan (DMP).  I have little experience of writing data management plans and I am not sure of the level of detail I’m required to give.

## Ideal experience

I have limited access to data management experience within my institution so I am looking to use the Research Data management (RDM) toolkit to help. I know the types and the approximate amounts of data I will generate, but I hadn’t previously thought about how to share data with my collaborators and how to store data securely.  Initially, my plan was to buy a powerful computer and portable hard drive, but I am now thinking that I need to use a national compute infrastructure.

The field I work in has well defined data and curation standards, for example, capturing information (metadata) about how to collect and sample our data.  However, I was not aware of the importance of storing provenance data, such as tool and database versions used in its analysis.

Additionally, the RDM toolkit helped signpost local Data Management training.  From this training I have learned about funder data management requirements, deposition repositories/data archives and tools for writing DMPs.

**Applies to:** PhD candidates, research grant applicants, project managers, group leaders, PIs

## Focus on

* Writing data management plans in the context of grant applications
* Ensure compliance with institution policy, including legal and ethical aspects
* Ensure proper data organisation and storage
* Ensure secure sharing, reproducibility and preservation of data

## How to get started with Research Data Management

1. Check out the various steps of the RDM life cycle, in particular the Planning stage.
2. Identify and contact the data steward in your local organisation or your national contact in the ELIXIR network.
3. Use local guidelines associated with the national or institutional DMP application and/or follow an [introductory training](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/search?q=Data%20Management%20Planning#materials).
4. Start planning your project, taking the DMP into account. 

## Considerations and common issues

You might run into these issues (privacy, security) and we have information on it (data life cycle stages)

* Is there data management support from the institution or the [ELIXIR Data management network](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge/wp1/dm-network)?
* What data management tools could be used for the different stages during the [RDM life cycle](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/index.html)?
* What tools can I use in the [planning phase](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/planning) of my project?
* How do I know if my data is [sensitive](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/data_classification.html) and how to ensure [data protection](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/data_protection.html)?
* What are suitable resources for data computation and storage during the project, considering size of data and who has access rights?
* How do I best capture those processes involved in creating and processing my data (workflow and analysis pipelines)?
* In which public repository should I [deposit](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/sharing) my data? 
* What metadata and community standards need to be [captured](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/collecting) to enable me to FAIR-publish in public repositories?
* What are the data retention policies for [my country](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge/wp1/dm-coordinators)?
